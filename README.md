# tinyframework

### Introduction
Using pure numpy to construct deep learning computational graph framework.

### Dev Tools： 
- pycharm

### Dependencies
- python: >= 3.7

### Features
- Based on computational graph, can be used to build common machine learning models.
- Support automatic derivation.
- Support common optimization methods (such as gd, momentum, adagrad, rmsprop, Adam, etc.)
- Support common evaluation methods (such as accuracy, precision, auc, f1_score, etc.)
